# Waxmanlab ChIP-seq pipeline

This versatile ChIP-seq pipeline processes raw sequencing data to identify protein-DNA interactions, filter high-quality reads, and perform differential peak analysis. It supports analyses for transcription factors (TF), differential accessibility regions (DAR), histone modifications, and ATAC-seq data.
